# Food Recommendation Website with Clean Code React using Vite

This tutorial will guide you through building a food recommendation website using React and Vite, with a focus on clean code practices. You will learn how to create a modern and performant website that fetches recipe data from an external API, renders the data in a user-friendly interface, and provides navigation for a seamless user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following software and tools installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git

If you don't have these installed, you can follow the official documentation to install them on your local development environment.

## Setup

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
2. Initialize an npm package in the project directory with `npm init`.
3. Install Vite as a development dependency with `npm install vite --save-dev`.
4. Configure a basic Vite project by following the documentation and clean code practices for setting up a React project with Vite.

## Building the User Interface

1. Create React components for the user interface of the food recommendation website, such as a homepage, search bar, and recipe cards.
2. Follow clean code practices for organizing and structuring React components, using functional components and hooks, and applying separation of concerns.

## Fetching Recipe Data

1. Use Axios or any other HTTP client library to fetch recipe data from an external API.
2. Handle errors and update the state with the fetched data.
3. Follow clean code practices for making API calls, handling async operations, and managing state in React.

## Rendering Recipe Data

1. Render the fetched recipe data on the website, such as displaying recipe cards with recipe names, images, and other relevant information.
2. Follow clean code practices for rendering and mapping through arrays of data in React.

## Styling the Website

1. Style the food recommendation website using CSS, CSS modules, or any other styling approach.
2. Follow clean code practices for organizing and writing CSS code, such as using CSS-in-JS libraries or modular CSS approaches.

## Adding Navigation

1. Use React Router or any other routing library to add navigation to the food recommendation website.
2. Create routes for different pages, handle navigation events, and update the UI accordingly.
3. Follow clean code practices for implementing navigation in a React application.

## Testing

1. Explain the importance of testing and provide examples of how to write unit tests or integration tests for components and functionality in the food recommendation website.
2. Use testing libraries such as Jest or React Testing Library.
3. Discuss the benefits of test-driven development and provide examples of clean code practices for writing effective tests.

## Deployment

1. Provide instructions on how to deploy the food recommendation website to a hosting service or platform, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
2. Configure the build and deployment process using Vite.
3. Follow clean code practices for optimizing the production build and deploying a performant website.
